Design Decisions – Phase 1

1. Used FAISS instead of managed vector DB
   Reason: full control, offline support, no cost, easier debugging.

2. Enforced absolute imports (backend.*)
   Reason: prevents deployment-time import failures.

3. Chose metadata-based versioning
   Reason: simpler rollback, better auditability, scalable to many versions.

4. No frontend in Phase 1
   Reason: backend correctness > UI polish at early stage.

5. Refusal on empty context
   Reason: avoids hallucinations and legal risk in enterprise systems.
